	<h1>Hobbit Meals</h1>
	<h2>If Hobbits lived in modern <b>USA</b>, these would be the meals and restaurants they would enjoy:</h2>
	
	<h4>1st Breakfast</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Grand Slam</b> at Dennys.</li>
			<li>Donuts (They might do Dunkin, but there are plenty of better quality donuts from local donut shops in most cities).</li>
			<li>Cracker Barrel. No reason necessary, they just would.</li>
			<li>All you can eat pancakes at IHOP.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>2nd Breakfast</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>All you can eat pancakes at IHOP (They would be there from open until 10:30 AM, depends when breakfast at McDonald's ends).</li>
			<li>Drive Thru at McDonald's (they would get breakfast meals for the hashbrowns, with an extra order of hashbrowns).</li>
			<li>Scones with jellies and jams.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Elevenses</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Any French cafe (pastries and mimosas).</li>
			<li>Hotel coffee / tea (they wouldn't stay at the hotel, they would just go there for coffee and tea).</li>
			<li>Cake from a bakery inside a grocery shop.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Luncheon</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Food Truck (any cuisine). Overall, Hobbits dislike adventure but I doubt their palate is limited.</li>
			<li>Chinese food / Pan Asian (they will have tried everything on the menu six times at this point).</li>
			<li>Any restaurant with a bar (to enjoy a beer or ale with their meal).</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Afternoon Tea</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Tea, made at home. Probably Twinnings brand.</li>
			<li>Any baked goods they made at home. Probably a pie or cobbler. Whatever is in season.</li>
			<li>Cookies. Either something light and fluffy or small and crisp.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Dinner</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Steak, or any meat, and vegetables from the grill. By the way, they are all King of the Hill-level grillmasters.</li>
			<li>Thanksgiving style dinner despite not being November. There will definitely be roasted turkey (They put the bird in around afternoon tea).</li>
			<li>Any Italian restaurant with several orders of breadsticks. Red wine unless they are having a white sauce or fish.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Supper</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Soup.</li>
			<li>Salad.</li>
			<li>Anything light. Just something to hold them over until they wake up for breakfast.</li>
		</ul>
