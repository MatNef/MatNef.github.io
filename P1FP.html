	<h1>What is a hobbit?</h1>
	<p>Hobbits are an imaginary race created by <b>J.R.R. Tolkien</b>. They are human like, just a smaller size.
	Bilbo, the hobbit protagonist of <i>The Hobbit</i> (Which is the prequel to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy), is the first of his kind that is introduced to the reader. 
	<br>Frodo is the hobbit protagonist of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy and is accompanied by three other hobbits: Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took. 
	The books were released over a span of years, from the late 1930's to mid 1950's. <br>Other fantastical races are introduced in his books such as elves and orcs, though I'm limiting these pages to just hobbits.
	You can find more information at the links below pertaining to the books or films.
